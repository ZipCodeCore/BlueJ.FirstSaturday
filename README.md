# First Saturday

`fork` this repository and `clone` it to your local machine.

This lab used to be done over the first weekend. Now, you get to do it on the second day.
Overall idea is to read the code, read the tests, and then write some code to pass all the tests.

Be sure to commit all your changes multiple times as you're working on the lab.

`git commit -m "checkpointing my work"` should do, be sure to change the message to something meaningful to the work you're saving.

When you are finished, and are passing all the tests, be sure to do a final `git commit` and `git push`.

## Lab Brief

The objective of this lab is to give you an opportunity to think through IF statements
and LOOPS (WHILE, DO WHILE, and FOR).

You will need to read the TEST classes first, to get a feel for what you have to write
for the CODE classes.

Work through code class src.main.java.WriteIFs.java, follow the directions for each method.
Run All Tests on the class until you pass them all.

Work through code class src.main.java.WriteLoops.java, follow the directions for each method.
Run All Tests on the class until you pass them all. For each of the loop methods,
you need to put the code about w = w + 1; inside of the loops. It lets the test know how
many iterations of the loop your code did. This data is used to make sure you passed the tests.

You may not change ANY existing test methods. You get extra credit(!) for each test you add.

Be sure to pass all the tests with your code.
